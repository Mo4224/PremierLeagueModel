Hello! Here is a predictive model of who would win, between teams within the Premier League. This model uses data from the 2018/2019 season. 
Teams: "Arsenal FC","Tottenham Hotspur FC", "Manchester City FC","Leicester City FC", "Crystal Palace FC", "Everton FC", "Burnley FC", "Southampton FC", "AFC Bournemouth", "Manchester United FC", "Liverpool FC", "Chelsea FC", "West Ham United FC", "Watford FC", "Newcastle United FC","Cardiff City FC", "Fulham FC", "Brighton & Hove Albion FC", "Huddersfield Town FC", and "Wolverhampton Wanderers FC"

Instructions: 
1. Download the app.R and the .csv file, which contains the data for the model. 
2. Open R Studio, and load the data file and the app.R 
3. MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY TO THE FILE IN WHICH THE DATA FILE AND APP.R ARE PLACED!
In order to run the model, you need to specify what teams you want to see the results for. 
4. In R Studio, type in the code var1="name of team you want". (Make sure to put the quotations around the name of the teams (e.g. "Arsenal FC")
5. Next, type in the code var2="name of team you want". (Make sure to put the quotations around the name of the teams (e.g. "Arsenal FC")
This will now allow the model to know what teams you want to compare who would win. 
6. Now to run the model, you will type in Winner(var1,var2)
7. You should get the results, in which will say what team is predicted to win, or if it is a tie. 


EXAMPLE OF CODE: 
var1="Arsenal FC"
var2="Leicester City FC"
Winner(var1,var2)

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my project!
